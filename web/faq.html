    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h3>What is the purpose of Multiple values?</h3>
    <p>
      Multiple values is a feature that allows you to track multiple values for the same data point.
      For example, you can track your cycling distance and time, or your body weight and body fat percentage.
      Values are always optional, but each data point must have at least one value.

    <h3>How to import data from another app?</h3>

    <p>
      Currently, Activity Tracker can not import data from other apps. 
      You can do the import manually: export your data 
      into a JSON file (in Activity Tracker Settings), modify this file by hand, 
      or by any suitable tools, and import it back into Activity Tracker. 
      Note that the JSON file is not validated, so you need to be careful with the import.
      Data points must be sorted by date in ascending order.
