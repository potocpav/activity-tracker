<b>Data Visualization</b>: Analyze your progress with interactive charts, calendars, box plots, line graphs, and histograms.

<b>Data Ownership</b>: Your data is stored locally on your device. You can export or back up your data into simple JSON or CSV files. You can open these files with your favourite spreadsheet editor or data analysis tools.
